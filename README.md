A.	Project Overview

After raising a substantial portion of the fundraising goal for her upcoming play Fever, Louise wants to know additional information about the relationship between campaign outcomes, fundraising goals, and launch dates. While it’s unclear exactly what she intends to use this information for, it could be used to pick a launch date or to determine whether she should raise her fundraising goal. This analysis will be preformed using a dataset from fundraising platform Kickstarter, which contains information on past media- related fundraising campaigns, including each production’s fundraising goal, pledged amount, deadline, launch date, category, and more. This paper describes the relationship between plays, launch dates, and fundraising goals using pivot tables and data visualizations.

B.	Process of Data Analysis

i.	Formatting the Data

The process of analyzing the dataset began with formatting the data to be most useful to the pivot tables. To do this, I converted the Unix code deadline into human readable form using the below formula, and then extracted the year from the resulting date using the Year() function.

I then converted the Category column into two columns labeled “Category” and “Subcategory,” allowing me to apply filters based on either the category or subcategory individually instead of only on the combination of the two. 

ii.	Analyzing Launch Date vs. Outcomes

After formatting the data to be readable, I began the analysis using pivot tables. I placed filters in the pivot table to filter out data based on both year launched and category, allowing me to control both the year of the data being used into the pivot table and the type of media that the campaigns were raising money for. Since my analysis only includes “theater” type campaigns, I used the filters to exclude all other categories.

I dragged the outcomes variable into “Columns” and “Values” and the launch data variable into Rows. This enabled me to visualize the total number of each type of outcome per month. I also excluded “live” outcomes from the pivot table, as requested. I then inserted a line graph to visualize the data.

iii.	Analyzing Fundraising Goal vs. Outcomes

In order to determine the number and percentage of projects that were successful based on the goal, I first broke the goal amount into discreet categories, with a new category every 5000 additional dollars. I then used the COUNTIFS function to pull the number of projects that fit a given couple of preconditions, in this case that they were within the given values for the goals variable and the outcome. 

 
I then used a simple division function to transform these raw numbers into ratios and visualized them by inserting a line graph.

iv.	Difficulties

I encountered some difficulty dragging the correct variables into which section of the pivot chart to have the data break out by month, but after a little bit of experimentation it worked out. Additionally, getting the function COUNTIFS to count only the number of cells that fit the correct goals range was difficult. I kept accidentally pulling in information from one value to the side of the given values.

C.	Results

i.	Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Conclusions

Using the line graph generated by plotting outcomes against launch dates, I am able to draw two major conclusions. First, the volume of projects that launch in the late spring and early summer far outstrips the volume of projects that launch any other time. Second, the projects that do launch in the late spring and early summer appear disproportionately likely to be successful. While both the number of failed and successful programs increase in this time frame, the number of successful programs increase more rapidly, suggesting that late spring and early summer are an ideal time to launch. Conversely, the projects that are launched in the winter appear less likely to be successful.

ii.	Theater Outcomes by Goals Conclusions

This graph is unusual because the ratio of successful programs to total programs in the goal ranges peaks twice, once at the lowest range (0-4999) and once at the third and fourth highest ranges (3500-44999). Reflecting the rough inverse of the successful program ratios, the ratio of failed programs to total programs peaks twice, once between 20000 and 34999 and for all programs with goals greater than 45000. The ratio of cancelled programs to total programs steadily increases at a rate of approximately .5% per additional thousand dollars. These three conclusions suggest that Louise should choose a fundraising goal between 0 and 4999 if having a successful program is her only metric. However, if she needs or wants to raise more money, she should choose a goal between 35000 and 44999.

iii.	Data Limitations and Additional Research

There are two significant limitations to this dataset. While it does suggest conclusions about the relationships between theater outcomes, launch dates, and fundraising goals, it does not definitively establish a causal link between input variables and outcomes. It is possible that launch dates are an intermediate variable, and people who are less likely to put on a successful production choose more winter dates, appearing to establish a link between launch dates and outcomes where none exist. This same limitation exists with respect to fundraising goals and launch success.

My table showing the number of outcomes for each month of launch dates is useful for mapping the most popular months for launches, but not particularly useful for determining which month is best and worst for successful outcomes. This chart doesn’t demonstrate the ratio of cancelled, failed, and successful outcomes to total shows per month, which would be necessary to isolate variability in success rates across time.

Ideally, additional analysis would be performed with more input data that could possibly impact success rates. This analysis could be run using a multivariate regression to isolate both the probability of random data variance and the impact of each variable on outcomes. Running a more comprehensive, multivariate test would help to isolate the causal impact of each variable, and increase the chances that a particular relationship is causal and not merely correlative. Additionally, another table mapping the ratios between outcomes and total shows per month would be an easy way to isolate the relationships outcomes and months.
